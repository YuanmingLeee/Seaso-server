found [here](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/windows-prerequisites.html).
### Unix User
run
```
sudo apt-get install mvn
# if that does not work
sudo apt-get install maven
```

Run the following line to verify:
```
mvn -version

Windows user may add maven to PATH if cmd says command `mvn` cannot be found.
